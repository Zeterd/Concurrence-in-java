# ConcurrenceInJava

Project with the aim of showing some concepts of concurrent programming in the programming language Java.

## About this project
This was a ConcurrentProgramming class assignment. This program features the differences between some kinds of Stacks and Sets, implemented in various ways.
The Stacks show the features of atomic instructions while the locks are mostly implemented with locks.
There are also some tests and benchmarks available should you wish to test them, see Notes.

## Getting Started

You're going to need jdk-8.

If you want to run our tests we also advise you to download [cooperari][1] and add it to your PATH (see Notes).

First, you have some example code provided by our teacher in the CodeExamples/ directory.
Second, there's our project inside the project folder.

The project's assignment is documented in assignment.pdf.

## Notes
Most of the instructions are on the assignment pdf on 1.4.
